/**
 * Amazon
 * Given an integer array, two players take turns picking a number from the ends of the array.
 * First, player one picks a number (either the left end or right end of the array) followed by player
 * two. Each time a player picks a particular numbers, it is no longer available to the other player.
 * This picking continues until all numbers in the array have been chosen. 
 * Once all numbers have been picked, the player with strictly larger score wins. 
 * Return whether or not player one will win. Player one starts first always.
 * You may assume that each player is playing to win 
 * (i.e. both players will always choose the maximum of the two numbers each turn) 
 * and that there will always be a winner (no tie).
